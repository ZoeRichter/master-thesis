To ensure structural integrity and minimize the risk to plant investment, a potential limitation of fuel-element life may result from graphite corrosion in the high-temperature regions of the core (T ≅ 1100 °C). This corrosion is caused primarily by reactions of graphite with the low concentrations of steam (0.01–0.1 ppm) that are normally present in the helium coolant Economical operation of the reactor requires that the steam concentrations be maintained at such low levels that corrosion rates will not impact the normal fuel cycle. In this paper, we develop a graphite-corrosion model and address this important practical problem.},

	abstract = {Fission products deposited in the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed {HTRs}, particularly in design basis accidents ({DBA}). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed {HTR} concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the {AVR}, an experimental pebble bed {HTR}, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in {AVR}. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in {AVR} was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5Ã¢Â€Â‰kg/y. Additional dust sources in {AVR} were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress. Dust has a size of about 1Ã¢Â€Â‰ ÃŽÂ¼m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2Ã¢Â€Â‰h ours. In future reactors, an efficient filtering via a gas tight containment is required because accidents with fast depressurizations induce dust mobilization. Enhanced core temperatures in normal operation as in {AVR} and broken fuel pebbles have to be considered, as inflammable dust concentrations in the gas phase.},

The argument is primarily based on the safety features of the special form of the fuel. This paper examines some of the assumptions underlying the safety case for high temperature gas cooled reactors and highlights ways in which there could be fuel failure even during normal operations of the reactor; these failures serve to create a radioactive inventory that could be released under accident conditions. It then describes the severe accident scenarios that are the greatest challenge to high temperature gas cooled reactor safety: ingress of air or water into the core. Then, the paper offers an overview of what could be learned from the experiences with high temperature gas cooled reactors that have been built; their operating history indicates differences between actual operations and theoretical behavior. Finally, the paper describes some of the multiple priorities that often drive reactor design, and how safety is compromised in the process of optimizing other priorities.},

The plant model encompasses all major components in the Xe-100 plant’s primary helium side including the pebble bed reactor, helium circulator, and steam generator, which transfers heat to the secondary steam side feeding steam to a steam-turbine in the Rankine cycle. The requirement for load following was to have a ramp rate of 5\% per minute when the turbine-generator power level ramps down from full power to 25\% power level and back to full power. The control approach, which pairs selected manipulated variables namely the: reactor control rods; helium circulator speed; feed water pump speed; turbine throttle valve to selected controlled variables namely the: reactor outlet temperature; main steam temperature; main steam pressure; turbine-generator power, is discussed in this paper. The controller actions on the manipulated variables and their response during the load following signal are illustrated. The deviation of the controlled variables during load following are shown within their required limits. This paper shows that the Xe-100 plant can achieve a 100 – 25 – 100\% electrical load ramp at a rate of 5\% per minute.},

	abstract = {Modular reactors with improved safety features have been developed after the Three-Mile Island accident. Economics of small modular reactors compared to large light water reactors whose power output is 10 times higher is the major issue for these kind of reactors to be introduced into the market. Based on the Chinese high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module ({HTR}-{PM}) project, this paper analyzes economical potentials of modular reactor nuclear power plants. The reactor plant equipments are divided into 6 categories such as {RPV} and reactor internals, other {NSSS} components and so on. The economic impact of these equipments is analyzed. It is found that the major difference between an {HTR}-{PM} plant and a {PWR} is the capital costs of the {RPV} and the reactor internals. The fact, however, that {RPV} and reactor internals costs account for only 2\% of the total plant costs in {PWR} plants demonstrates the limited influence of this difference. On the premise of multiple {NSSS} modules forming a nuclear power plant with a plant capacity equivalent to a typical {PWR} plant, an upper value and a target value of the total plant capital costs are estimated. A comparison is made for two design proposals of the Chinese {HTR}-{PM} project. It is estimated that the specific costs of a ready-to-build 2×250MWth modular plant will be only 5\% higher than the specific costs of one 458MWth plant. When considering the technical uncertainties of the latter, a 2×250MWth modular plant seems to be more attractive. Finally, four main points are listed for {MHTGRs} to achieve economic viability.},

	abstract = {A multitude of problems that are encountered in large {HTR} power plans, constructively as well as concerning plant safety, can be related to the mere physical size of a large reactor core. In limiting the thermal power of an {HTR}-module to approximately 200 {MW} an inherent limitation of the fuel element temperature below critical values can be guaranteed for all possible core heat up accidents. Consequently, a significant failure rate of coated particles can be excluded and, hence, out of physical reasons, no intolerable fission product release from the core will ever have to be considered. The {HTR}-module is so qualified and very well suited for all possible plant sides which have to be taken into consideration for medium sized plants for the production of process steam and electricity. The cost investigations show considerable cost advantages for modular {HTRs}. For German conditions it was found that even a four-modular plant (800 {MW}/thermal) is competitive with a fossile-fueled plant of the same size, the specific plant costs were evaluated to be {DM} 4700/{kW} (electric). Moreover the investigations show that the increase of the power of the modular unit yields only small cost advantages, therefore in a modularized power plant it even would be possible to reduce the power of a modular unit below 200 {MW} without having to cope with severe economic penalties, if the distance from technological or safety limits is felt to be too small.},

	url = {https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/820874/},
	abstract = {Based an the physical properties of pebble bed reactors, a multitude of variations are possible in the layout of the fuel and fuelling schemes. These properties are being exploited in a conceptual design, offering an attractive layout in terms of the inter-related aspects of safety, economy and simplicity. Advantages of this layout are highlighted by means of a direct comparison to a similar reactor characterised by a conventional fuelling scheme. The proposed concept is characterised by the following: In the {OTTO} (\${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$nce \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hrough \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hen \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ut) fuelling scheme the fuel spheres pass through the core once only. Therefore the fuel recirculation subsystems may be negated in the design. The {PAP}2 (\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$ower \${\textbackslash}underline\{A\}\$djusted by-\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$oison) fuelling scheme involves adding of pebbles with burnable poison that will lead to a strong flattening of the axial core power density. These absorber spheres contain coated particles of B\$\_\{4\}\$C instead of fuel. In the radial direction flattening of the power density is achieved by increasing the loading of graphite spheres into the central fuelling channel (2-zone fuelling). The advantages of a relatively high power performance (250 {MW}\$\_\{th\}\$), a high heavy metal loading per fuel element (14g\$\_\{{HM}\}\$), and high burnup (120 {MWd}/Kg\$\_\{{HM}\}\$ can be directly translated into an economical advantage. Lowly enriched uranium is employed as fuel which provides a highly proliferation resistant solution when coupled to the high burnup and oncethrough only cycle. The control capability includes unlimited power variations within the operational range of 100-20-100\%. In the proposed concept the reactor is coupled to a power conversion unit which employs a direct cycle helium power turbine. - During a loss of coolant ({DLOFC} = Depressurised Loss Of Forced Coolant) event, the fuel element temperature is passively limited below 1600 °C, thus avoiding any radioactive release. Computationally the reactor is simulated by means of the {VSOP} (\${\textbackslash}underline\{V\}\$ery \${\textbackslash}underline\{S\}\$uperior \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ld \${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$rograms) staple of codes. For this purpose the following extensions to the code have been developed: A so-called onion-skin burnup model is introduced to calculate the burnup of the B\$\_\{4\}\$C kernels. Within the absorber spheres the burnup of the coated (B\$\_\{4\}\$C) particles are being followed in a nurnher of separate fiel zones. Based an experimental findings a fuel sphere flog scheine has been developed, which moves downward in parallel in the top area, while the bottorn area is re-organised in a funnel shape towards die de fuelling pipe in accordance with the angle of the conus and discharge rate. A 3-D geometric modeller, {FIRZIT} (i.e. in \${\textbackslash}phi\$-r-z-ordinates) has been exclusively developed for modelling the so-called noses, employed for housing the cold shut down system in a core with 3,5 m diarneter. This enables the modelling of various pebble flow schernes in azimuthal segments. [...] Mulder, E. J.},

In the core, there exist many fuel balls piled up randomly in a high packing fraction. And each fuel ball contains a lot of small fuel particles which are also distributed randomly. In this study, to realize precise neutron transport calculation of such reactors with the continuous energy Monte Carlo method, a new sampling method has been developed. The new method has been implemented in the general purpose Monte Carlo code {MCNP} to develop a modified version {MCNP}-{BALL}. This method was validated by calculating inventory of spherical fuel elements arranged successively by sampling during transport calculation and also by performing criticality calculations in ordered packing models. From the results, it was confirmed that the inventory of spherical fuel elements could be reproduced using {MCNP}-{BALL} within a sufficient accuracy of 0.2\%. And the comparison of criticality calculations in ordered packing models between {MCNP}-{BALL} and the reference method shows excellent agreement in neutron spectrum as well as multiplication factor. {MCNP}-{BALL} enables us to analyze pebble bed type cores such as {PROTEUS} precisely with the continuous energy Monte Carlo method.},

	abstract = {Fission products play an important role in the safety and fuel integrity of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor ({HTGR}) and they depend on temperature, burnup, neutron energy distribution, and fast fluence. Energy distribution of neutrons in a fuel region determines the isotopic distribution of the fission products to be produced. The local concentrations of these isotopes are considered to be functions of temperature and burnup as well as the amount transported from the kernel to the coating layers where they interact and may degrade layers. Thus, the integrity of the fuel particle may be lost and fission products can be released into the reactor coolant inventory. In this study, it is the main purpose to perform neutron energy spectrum shift in spherical {HTGR} fuels and to investigate its effect on fission products. Moreover, it is also intended to analyze the effect of unit cell geometries on criticality of the system. The calculations for group fluxes based on {ENDF}4 library with 27 neutron energy groups are accomplished by the {MCNP}5 neutron transport code. Burnup and criticality analyses are performed by using the {MONTEBURNS}2 code ({MCNP}5 coupled with {ORIGENS}). To simplify the neutron transport problem, instead of full core modeling, two fundamental unit cell arrangements, body-centered cubic ({BCC}) and hexagonal close-packed ({HCP}) lattices, are considered to be as reference geometry models. Unit cells are defined with proper boundary conditions and random packing for {TRISO} particles provided by the stochastic geometry card specified in {MCNP}5 for {HTGR} pebbles is used.},

For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Because of the difficulties in geometric modelling, our previous Monte Carlo ({MC}) simulations for pebblebed reactors were usually done by using regular lattice approximations, without fully considering stochastic double heterogeneity. In this paper, an explicit-modelling approach is developed with the reactor Monte Carlo code {RMC} and in-house packing tools, in order to model pebble-bed reactors more accurately. The explicit-modelling approach is examined for physical analyses of {HTR}-10. Good agreements are observed among the results of explicit-modelling calculation with {RMC}, the deterministic calculation with {VSOP}, and the criticality experiment. Besides, stochastic effects of random distributed {CFPs} and pebbles are analyzed by constructing independent explicit models.},

	abstract = {The continuous loading and circulation of pebble type fuel in a pebble bed reactor have the advantage of a small excess reactivity with the associated safety and economical advantages. In a pebble-bed the exact position and properties of any given fuel element are not known as the fuel is loaded randomly on top of the pebble-bed and then flows through the reactor. However, since we have a large number of fuel elements in the core, nearly half a million in the case of the {PBMR} design, only the average behaviour can be investigated. The question on how well the average represents the properties of individual fuel elements is investigated with the aim to quantify the power peaking in pebble bed reactors and specifically the {PBMR} design. The power densities of artificially introduced fresh fuel spheres were selected to serve as a simple and conservative way to study any statistical variations in fuel loading, flow speeds and clustering of more reactive fuel. The study shows that although the maximum power delivered in a fuel sphere may increase due to clustering and statistical variation, the maximum values are still far below the design values with only moderate increases in fuel temperatures. Even the concentration of thousands of fresh fuel spheres filling the calculational region volume where the peak power occurs, increased the maximum power per fuel sphere with only 15\% and the maximum fuel temperatures are still acceptable. The main reasons for this are strong feedback effects and that the maximum fuel temperature does not occur in the same position as the maximum power densities. Further studies have shown that operational changes, such as the control rod movement, may show an increase of 6\% in the maximum power per fuel sphere. In all cases the peak fuel sphere power and maximum fuel temperature stay far below the limits set in the design and does not represent a safety issue.},

	abstract = {Benchmark calculations for the core of the 400MWth Pebble-bed Modular Reactor ({PBMR}), being developed in South Africa, were carried out by using {MCNP}5 code as a part of establishing Monte Carlo computation system for {HTGR} core analysis. After the detailed {MCNP} modeling of the whole facility, two neutronic benchmark problems, for fresh fuel and cold conditions(Case F-1), and first core loading with given number densities(Case F-2), proposed by the {IAEA} {CRP}5 was pursued. The resulting keff was calculated to be 1.2795±0.00052 and 1.1401±0.00055 for Case F-1 and F-2, respectively. It was found that these results were different with the results from other research group using {MCNP}4b, because 3 bottom cone regions and defueling chutes were assumed as the surfaces flattened in {MCNP}4b calculations while these were modeled explicitly in this study. This study can be contributed and utilized directly in the establishment of benchmark problems to develop deterministic neutronics analysis tools and methods, which lagged behind the state of the art compared to other reactor technologies, to design and analyze {PBMR}.},

For the double-heterogeneous geometry of pebble bed, traditional Monte Carlo codes can treat it by explicit geometry description. However, packing methods such as Random Sequential Addition ({RSA}) can only produce a sphere packing up to 38\% volume packing fraction, while Discrete Element Method ({DEM}) is troublesome and also time consuming. Moreover, traditional Monte Carlo codes are difficult and inconvenient to simulate the mixed and polytype particles or pebbles. A new random geometry method was developed in Monte Carlo code {RMC} to simulate the particle transport in polytype particle/pebble in double heterogeneous geometry systems. This method was verified by some test cases, and applied to the full core calculations of {HTR}-10 benchmark. The reactivity, temperature coefficient and control rod worth of {HTR}-10 were compared for full core and initial core in helium and air atmosphere respectively, and the results agree well with the benchmark results and experimental results. This work would provide an efficient tool for the innovative design of pebble bed, prism {HTRs} and molten salt reactors with polytype particles or pebbles using Monte Carlo method.},

The research and development associated with this endeavor was undertaken under the former Atomic Energy Commission Power Reactor Demonstration Program. Preliminary low power and intermediate power tests have proved the design concept features and calculations and most of the components. Safe conditions following loss of coolant were confirmed. Release of radioactivity from the fuel was less than predicted up to 70\% full power. Modifications and repairs caused delays and included, chiefly: Pelton wheel emergency cooling drives, helium circulator bearings, the pressure-regulating system for water lubricant in circulator bearings, liner cooling lines, removal of moisture from the vessel, electrical cable rerouting, helium seals around control rod drives, and a leak in one steam generator. Core temperature oscillation problems are being analyzed before passing the currently imposed 70\% power level. Fort St. Vrain has demonstrated that the concept of a large {HTGR} system incorporating a prestressed concrete reactor vessel is sound. The station has produced more than 500 million kilowatt hours of electric energy to date.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0306-4549(01)00110-4},
	abstract = {A new deterministic method has been developed for the neutronics analysis of a pebble-bed reactor ({PBR}). The method accounts for the ﬂow of pebbles explicitly and couples the ﬂow to the neutronics. The method allows modeling of once-through cycles as well as cycles in which pebbles are recirculated through the core an arbitrary number of times. This new work is distinguished from older methods by the systematically semi-analytical approach it takes. In particular, whereas older methods use the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approach (or an equivalent one) for the discretization and the solution of the burnup equation, the present work integrates the relevant diﬀerential equation analytically in discrete and complementary sub-domains of the reactor. Like some of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence codes, the new method obtains the asymptotic fuel-loading pattern directly, without modeling any intermediate loading pattern. This is a signiﬁcant advantage for the design and optimization of the asymptotic fuel-loading pattern. The new method is capable of modeling directly both the once-through-then-out fuel cycle and the pebble recirculating fuel cycle. Although it currently includes a ﬁnite-diﬀerence neutronics solver, the new method has been implemented into a modular code that incorporates the framework for the future coupling to an eﬃcient solver such as a nodal method and to modern cross section preparation capabilities. In its current state, the deterministic method presented here is capable of quick and eﬃcient design and optimization calculations for the in-core {PBR} fuel cycle. The method can also be used as a practical ‘‘scoping’’ tool. It could, for example, be applied to determine the potential of the {PBR} for resisting nuclear-weapons proliferation and to optimize proliferation-resistant features. However, the purpose of this paper is to show that the method itself is viable. Reﬁnements to the code are under way, with the objective of producing a powerful reactor physics analysis tool for {PBRs}. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper surveys the generic features: programming language, parallel operation, tracked particles, nuclear data, geometry, simulation modes, standard variance reduction techniques, sources, tracking and collision algorithms, tallies, sensitivity studies. Moreover, specific and recent features are also detailed: Doppler broadening of the elastic scattering kernel, neutron and photon material irradiation, advanced variance reduction techniques, Green’s functions, cycle correlation correction, nuclear data management and depletion capabilities. The production tools (T4G, {SALOME} {TRIPOLI}, T4RootTools), the verification and validation process and the distribution and licensing policy are finally presented.},
