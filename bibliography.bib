To ensure structural integrity and minimize the risk to plant investment, a potential limitation of fuel-element life may result from graphite corrosion in the high-temperature regions of the core (T ≅ 1100 °C). This corrosion is caused primarily by reactions of graphite with the low concentrations of steam (0.01–0.1 ppm) that are normally present in the helium coolant Economical operation of the reactor requires that the steam concentrations be maintained at such low levels that corrosion rates will not impact the normal fuel cycle. In this paper, we develop a graphite-corrosion model and address this important practical problem.},

	abstract = {Babcock and Wilcox (B\&W) has been producing high quality uranium oxycarbide ({UCO}) kernels for Advanced Gas Reactor ({AGR}) fuel tests at the Idaho National Laboratory. In 2005, 350-μm, 19.7\% 235U-enriched {UCO} kernels were produced for the {AGR}-1 test fuel. Following coating of these kernels and forming the coated-particles into compacts, this fuel was irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor ({ATR}) from December 2006 until November 2009. B\&W produced 425-μm, 14\% enriched {UCO} kernels in 2008, and these kernels were used to produce fuel for the {AGR}-2 experiment that was inserted in {ATR} in 2010. B\&W also produced 500μm, 9.6\% enriched {UO}2 kernels for the {AGR}-2 experiment. Kernels of the same size and enrichment as {AGR}-1 were also produced for the {AGR}-3/4 experiment. In addition to fabricating enriched {UCO} and {UO}2 kernels, B\&W has produced more than 100 kg of natural uranium {UCO} kernels which are being used in coating development tests. Successive lots of kernels have demonstrated consistent high quality and also allowed for fabrication process improvements. Improvements in kernel forming were made subsequent to {AGR}-1 kernel production. Following fabrication of {AGR}-2 kernels, incremental increases in sintering furnace charge size have been demonstrated. Recently small scale sintering tests using a small development furnace equipped with a residual gas analyzer ({RGA}) have increased understanding of how kernel sintering parameters affect sintered kernel properties. The steps taken to increase throughput and process knowledge have reduced kernel production costs. Studies have been performed of additional modifications toward the goal of increasing capacity of the current fabrication line to use for production of first core fuel for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant ({NGNP}) and providing a basis for the design of a full scale fuel fabrication facility.},

	abstract = {Fission products deposited in the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed {HTRs}, particularly in design basis accidents ({DBA}). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed {HTR} concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the {AVR}, an experimental pebble bed {HTR}, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in {AVR}. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in {AVR} was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5Ã¢Â€Â‰kg/y. Additional dust sources in {AVR} were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress. Dust has a size of about 1Ã¢Â€Â‰ ÃŽÂ¼m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2Ã¢Â€Â‰h ours. In future reactors, an efficient filtering via a gas tight containment is required because accidents with fast depressurizations induce dust mobilization. Enhanced core temperatures in normal operation as in {AVR} and broken fuel pebbles have to be considered, as inflammable dust concentrations in the gas phase.},

The argument is primarily based on the safety features of the special form of the fuel. This paper examines some of the assumptions underlying the safety case for high temperature gas cooled reactors and highlights ways in which there could be fuel failure even during normal operations of the reactor; these failures serve to create a radioactive inventory that could be released under accident conditions. It then describes the severe accident scenarios that are the greatest challenge to high temperature gas cooled reactor safety: ingress of air or water into the core. Then, the paper offers an overview of what could be learned from the experiences with high temperature gas cooled reactors that have been built; their operating history indicates differences between actual operations and theoretical behavior. Finally, the paper describes some of the multiple priorities that often drive reactor design, and how safety is compromised in the process of optimizing other priorities.},

The plant model encompasses all major components in the Xe-100 plant’s primary helium side including the pebble bed reactor, helium circulator, and steam generator, which transfers heat to the secondary steam side feeding steam to a steam-turbine in the Rankine cycle. The requirement for load following was to have a ramp rate of 5\% per minute when the turbine-generator power level ramps down from full power to 25\% power level and back to full power. The control approach, which pairs selected manipulated variables namely the: reactor control rods; helium circulator speed; feed water pump speed; turbine throttle valve to selected controlled variables namely the: reactor outlet temperature; main steam temperature; main steam pressure; turbine-generator power, is discussed in this paper. The controller actions on the manipulated variables and their response during the load following signal are illustrated. The deviation of the controlled variables during load following are shown within their required limits. This paper shows that the Xe-100 plant can achieve a 100 – 25 – 100\% electrical load ramp at a rate of 5\% per minute.},

	abstract = {Modular reactors with improved safety features have been developed after the Three-Mile Island accident. Economics of small modular reactors compared to large light water reactors whose power output is 10 times higher is the major issue for these kind of reactors to be introduced into the market. Based on the Chinese high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module ({HTR}-{PM}) project, this paper analyzes economical potentials of modular reactor nuclear power plants. The reactor plant equipments are divided into 6 categories such as {RPV} and reactor internals, other {NSSS} components and so on. The economic impact of these equipments is analyzed. It is found that the major difference between an {HTR}-{PM} plant and a {PWR} is the capital costs of the {RPV} and the reactor internals. The fact, however, that {RPV} and reactor internals costs account for only 2\% of the total plant costs in {PWR} plants demonstrates the limited influence of this difference. On the premise of multiple {NSSS} modules forming a nuclear power plant with a plant capacity equivalent to a typical {PWR} plant, an upper value and a target value of the total plant capital costs are estimated. A comparison is made for two design proposals of the Chinese {HTR}-{PM} project. It is estimated that the specific costs of a ready-to-build 2×250MWth modular plant will be only 5\% higher than the specific costs of one 458MWth plant. When considering the technical uncertainties of the latter, a 2×250MWth modular plant seems to be more attractive. Finally, four main points are listed for {MHTGRs} to achieve economic viability.},

	abstract = {A multitude of problems that are encountered in large {HTR} power plans, constructively as well as concerning plant safety, can be related to the mere physical size of a large reactor core. In limiting the thermal power of an {HTR}-module to approximately 200 {MW} an inherent limitation of the fuel element temperature below critical values can be guaranteed for all possible core heat up accidents. Consequently, a significant failure rate of coated particles can be excluded and, hence, out of physical reasons, no intolerable fission product release from the core will ever have to be considered. The {HTR}-module is so qualified and very well suited for all possible plant sides which have to be taken into consideration for medium sized plants for the production of process steam and electricity. The cost investigations show considerable cost advantages for modular {HTRs}. For German conditions it was found that even a four-modular plant (800 {MW}/thermal) is competitive with a fossile-fueled plant of the same size, the specific plant costs were evaluated to be {DM} 4700/{kW} (electric). Moreover the investigations show that the increase of the power of the modular unit yields only small cost advantages, therefore in a modularized power plant it even would be possible to reduce the power of a modular unit below 200 {MW} without having to cope with severe economic penalties, if the distance from technological or safety limits is felt to be too small.},

	abstract = {The driving forces in the development of {SMRs} are their specific characteristics. They can be deployed
incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. {SMRs} show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability {SMR} designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some {SMR} designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of {SMR} technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of {SMR} designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of {SMRs} of all the major
technology lines within the category of {SMRs}. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific {SMRs} is provided by the responsible institute or

	title = {Pebble bed reactor with equalised core power distribution inherently safe and simple},
	url = {https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/820874/},
	abstract = {Based an the physical properties of pebble bed reactors, a multitude of variations are possible in the layout of the fuel and fuelling schemes. These properties are being exploited in a conceptual design, offering an attractive layout in terms of the inter-related aspects of safety, economy and simplicity. Advantages of this layout are highlighted by means of a direct comparison to a similar reactor characterised by a conventional fuelling scheme. The proposed concept is characterised by the following: In the {OTTO} (\${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$nce \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hrough \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hen \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ut) fuelling scheme the fuel spheres pass through the core once only. Therefore the fuel recirculation subsystems may be negated in the design. The {PAP}2 (\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$ower \${\textbackslash}underline\{A\}\$djusted by-\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$oison) fuelling scheme involves adding of pebbles with burnable poison that will lead to a strong flattening of the axial core power density. These absorber spheres contain coated particles of B\$\_\{4\}\$C instead of fuel. In the radial direction flattening of the power density is achieved by increasing the loading of graphite spheres into the central fuelling channel (2-zone fuelling). The advantages of a relatively high power performance (250 {MW}\$\_\{th\}\$), a high heavy metal loading per fuel element (14g\$\_\{{HM}\}\$), and high burnup (120 {MWd}/Kg\$\_\{{HM}\}\$ can be directly translated into an economical advantage. Lowly enriched uranium is employed as fuel which provides a highly proliferation resistant solution when coupled to the high burnup and oncethrough only cycle. The control capability includes unlimited power variations within the operational range of 100-20-100\%. In the proposed concept the reactor is coupled to a power conversion unit which employs a direct cycle helium power turbine. - During a loss of coolant ({DLOFC} = Depressurised Loss Of Forced Coolant) event, the fuel element temperature is passively limited below 1600 °C, thus avoiding any radioactive release. Computationally the reactor is simulated by means of the {VSOP} (\${\textbackslash}underline\{V\}\$ery \${\textbackslash}underline\{S\}\$uperior \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ld \${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$rograms) staple of codes. For this purpose the following extensions to the code have been developed: A so-called onion-skin burnup model is introduced to calculate the burnup of the B\$\_\{4\}\$C kernels. Within the absorber spheres the burnup of the coated (B\$\_\{4\}\$C) particles are being followed in a nurnher of separate fiel zones. Based an experimental findings a fuel sphere flog scheine has been developed, which moves downward in parallel in the top area, while the bottorn area is re-organised in a funnel shape towards die de fuelling pipe in accordance with the angle of the conus and discharge rate. A 3-D geometric modeller, {FIRZIT} (i.e. in \${\textbackslash}phi\$-r-z-ordinates) has been exclusively developed for modelling the so-called noses, employed for housing the cold shut down system in a core with 3,5 m diarneter. This enables the modelling of various pebble flow schernes in azimuthal segments. [...] Mulder, E. J.},

	abstract = {Fission products deposited in the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed {HTRs}, particularly in design basis accidents ({DBA}). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed {HTR} concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the {AVR}, an experimental pebble bed {HTR}, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in {AVR}. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in {AVR} was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5 kg/y. Additional dust sources in {AVR} were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress. Dust has a size of about 1   𝜇 m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2 hours. In future reactors, an efficient filtering via a gas tight containment is required because accidents with fast depressurizations induce dust mobilization. Enhanced core temperatures in normal operation as in {AVR} and broken fuel pebbles have to be considered, as inflammable dust concentrations in the gas phase.},
