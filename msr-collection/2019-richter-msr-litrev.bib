	abstract = {A thermal–hydraulics study of the core of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is presented. The numerical simulations were carried-out using a Computation Fluid Dynamic code. The main objectives of the thermal–hydraulics studies are to design the core cavity walls in order to increase the overall flow mixing and to reduce the temperature peaking factors in the salt and on the core walls. The results of the CFD simulations show that for the chosen core design acceptable temperature distributions can be obtained by using a curved core cavity shape, inlets and outlets. The hot spot temperature is less than 10 °C above the average core outlet temperature and is located in the centre of the top wall of the core. The results show also a moderate level of sensitivity to the working point.},

The reactor vessel is 22ft in diameter × 20 ft high and is fabricated of Hastelloy-N with graphite as the moderator and reflector. The fuel is 233U carried in a LiF-BeF2-ThF4 mixture which is molten above 930°F. Thorium is converted to 233U in excess of fissile burnup so that bred material is a plant product. The estimated fuel yield is 3.3\% per year.The estimated construction cost of the station is comparable to PWR total construction costs. The power production cost, including fuel-cycle and graphite replacement costs, with private utility financing, is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 mill/kWh less than that for present-day light-water reactors, largely due to the low fuel-cycle cost and high plant thermal efficiency.After engineering development of the fuel purification processes and large-scale components, a practical plant similar to the one described here appears to be feasible.},

	abstract = {A personal history of the development of molten salt reactors in the United States is presented. The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956, the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a circulating UF4-ThF4 fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy N pressure boundary. The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission’s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology and prospects for revived interest are summarized.},

	abstract = {The IMSR uses molten fluoride salt, a highly stable, inert liquid with robust coolant properties and high intrinsic radionuclide retention properties, for its primary fuel salt. A secondary, coolant salt loop, also using a fluoride salt (but without fuel), transfers heat away from the primary heat exchangers integrated inside the core-unit. The coolant salt loop, in turn, transfers its heat load to a solar salt loop, which is pumped out of the nuclear island to a separate building where it either heats steam generators that generate superheated steam for power generation or is used for process heat applications. The safety philosophy behind the IMSR is to produce a nuclear power plant with generation IV reactor levels of safety. For ultimate safety, there is no dependence on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or their support systems, such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with upset conditions. This is achieved through a combination of design features: the inert, stable properties of the salt; an inherently stable nuclear core; fully passive backup core and containment cooling systems; and an integral reactor architecture.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are liquid-fuel reactors, in which the fuel is also the coolant and flows through the core. A particular configuration presented in this paper called the Molten Salt Fast Reactor consists in a Molten Salt Reactor with no moderator inside the core and a salt composition that leads to a fast neutron spectrum. Previous studies showed that this concept (previously called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor – Nonmoderated) has very promising characteristics. The liquid fuel implies a special reprocessing. Each day a small amount of the fuel salt is extracted from the core for on-site reprocessing. To study such a reactor, the materials evolution within the core has to be coupled to the reprocessing unit, since the latter cleans the salt quasi continuously and feeds the reactor. This paper details the issues associated to the numerical coupling of the core and the reprocessing. It presents how the chemistry is introduced inside the classical Bateman equation (evolution of nuclei within a neutron flux) in order to carry a numerical coupled study. To achieve this goal, the chemistry has to be modeled numerically and integrated to the equations of evolution. This paper presents how is it possible to describe the whole concept (reactor+reprocessing unit) by a system of equations that can be numerically solved. Our program is a connection between MCNP and a homemade evolution code called REM. Thanks to this tool; constraints on the fuel reprocessing were identified. Limits are specified to preserve the good neutronics properties of the MSFR. In this paper, we show that the limit rate for the reprocessing is 2.5l of fuel salt a day, which means that the fuel should be reprocessed within 7000days approximately if there is a specific way to control the redox potential of the salt. Finally, a last part of this paper analyzes the impact of chemical parameter uncertainties on the reprocessing performance.},

	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},
