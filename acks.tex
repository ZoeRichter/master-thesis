I'd like to thank Dr. Madicken Munk, my advisor,  whose insight and experience was invaluable; and Professor Tomasz Kozlowski, my second reader for giving me their expertise.  To Nathan Ryan of the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group, my tireless reviewer: thank you for all of your hard work.  

I would also like to thank everyone else in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group, past and present, for giving me their time, aid, and advice: Amanda Bachmann, Dr. Andrei Rykhlevskii, Ansh Chaube, Greg Westphal, Gwendolyn Chee, Mehmet Turkmen, Nataly Panczyk, Roberto Fairhurst, Sam Dotson, and Sun Myung Park.  

Thank you to my family, for always believing in me; Trinket, for loving hugs; and Sara, without whom nothing in this project would have a good name.
