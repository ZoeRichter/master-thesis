I'd like to thank my advisor, Dr. Kathryn Huff, for offering her knowledge and support through these trying times and uncertainties.  I would also like to thank Dr. Madicken Munk, whose insight and experience was invaluable.  To Nathan Ryan, my tireless reviewer: thank you for all of your hard work.  I would like to thank everyone in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group, past and present, for giving me their time, aid, and experience: Amanda Bachmann, Dr. Andrei Rykhlevskii, Ansh Chaube, Greg Westphal, Gwendolyn Chee, Mehmet Turkmen, Roberto Fairhurst, Sam Dotson, and Sun Myung Park.  

Thank you to my family, for always believing in me; Trinket, for loving hugs; and Sara, without whom nothing in this project would have a good name.
